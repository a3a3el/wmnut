WMNut
=====

Description
-----------

WMNut is a program to monitor multiple UPS devices' statistics through the NUT
(link:http://www.networkupstools.org[Network UPS Tools]) framework on Linux
and other systems.

It is a dockapp that is supported natively by X window managers such as
Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, FluxBox, and Enlightenment.

WMNut will run as a simple 64*64 pixels window in other Window Managers, or
when using *-w*.

WMNut provides multiple UPS's monitoring with:

- Status of power supply (battery or AC Power),
- Communication status with UPS (Red/Green "C"),
- Percentage of battery remaining (numeric and meter),
- Load level percentage on output (numeric, if available),
- Runtime to empty, i.e. time left to battery depletion (MM:SS),
- High/Low/Critical battery status (Red/Yellow/Green colored meter and battery).

It is known to run on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OpenIndiana, but should
also run on any other system supporting X11.

Like NUT, it may require C99 or newer compiler support.

WMNut releases.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

WMNut requires the:

- X Window client and Xpm libraries and development files.
  * For example on a Debian GNU/Linux system, you need to install the packages
    `libxext-dev` and `libxpm-dev`.
- NUT client library, version 2.8.0 or higher (may actually still work with
  2.2.1 or higher -- but at at expense of build warnings with data types).
  * For example on a Debian GNU/Linux system, you need to install the package
    `libupsclient-dev` (note that some stable distributions still ship older
    NUT v2.7.4 based packages!)

In order to compile WMNut using the `Makefile`, GNU `make` must be used.

NOTE: For FreeBSD and OpenIndiana users, the default BSD or Sun `make` programs
respectively do not work for recipes used here, so in case of problems --
use `gmake` instead!

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Download WMNut source code (from GitHub) or archive (`.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`)

Either get file from link:http://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut/downloads[WMNut downloads]
or clone the git repository using:

	$ git clone git://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut.git

2) Uncompress the archive (not needed for github source code)

	$ tar -zxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.gz
	$ tar -jxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.bz2

3) Switch to WMNut source code directory

	$ cd wmnut-X.YZ

If you are using the git source code, use:

	$ cd wmnut

4) Prepare the source for building

[NOTE]
================================================================================
when using the git repository, be sure to first call:

	$ autoreconf -i
================================================================================

Just call the usual:

	$ ./configure

[NOTE]
================================================================================
WMNut now uses `pkg-config` to determine the location of NUT library and
headers by default. Alternatively, you can point to systems-dependent
location of a custom NUT build or installation (`make install DESTDIR=...`)
area, like this:

	NUT_LIBS="-L${HOME}/nut/clients/.libs -lupsclient" \
	NUT_CFLAGS="-I${HOME}/nut/include -I${HOME}/nut/clients" \
	./configure
	
	# You would need to install that libdir or pass it with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	# to run the built program experimentally, e.g.:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/nut/clients/.libs ./src/wmnut -w
================================================================================

5) Now compile WMNut

	$ make

Or (for *BSD and illumos based systems):

	$ gmake

6) And install it on your system

Use the following command, as `root` (or using `sudo`):

	$ make install

Or simply copy the `wmnut` binary (and optionally its manual page) to the
right directories on your system.

7) Optionally, configure WMNut for your own use

WMNut will automatically connect to any local device(s).

So if you have remote system(s) that you want to monitor, edit and adapt your
`wmnutrc` file . Then copy it to your user home directory and/or to your system
`/etc` directory, using commands like:

	$ cp wmnutrc /etc/wmnutrc

and/or:

	$ cp wmnutrc ~/.wmnutrc

[NOTE]
================================================================================
- as of WMNut 0.65, `wmnutrc` is installed now, to `/etc` by default
- if both files exist, `~/.wmnutrc` takes precedence,
- command line options take precedence over configuration files,
- on Debian, a sample `wmnutrc` is located in `/usr/share/doc/wmnut/`.
================================================================================

8) Launch WMNut

	$ wmnut &

You can also use `wmnut -h` for help, or `man wmnut` to access the manual page.

If no parameter is given, wmnut will try to access the UPS at "localhost"
address. Otherwise try `wmnut -U upsname@hostname` or edit your `wmnutrc` files.

Be sure to read the `HINTS` and `TODO` files too!

WMNut is based on `wmapm` originally written by Chris D. Faulhaber and
M.G. Henderson.

Huge thanks to:

- Russell Kroll for having initiated and driven the NUT project
(link:http://www.networkupstools.org[Network UPS Tools]), until 2004.
Note that I have however taken over NUT leadership since 2005...
- Bill Richter, Laszlo Hazy and David Butts for their support in beta test
and improvement of WMNut,
- Martijm Pieterse and Antoine Nulle for a great (and somewhat standardised)
interface which I used as a template (wmmon.app and wmgeneral),
- Luca Filipozzi for WMNut Debian package creation, which I now personally hold,
available at link:http://packages.debian.org/wmnut[Debian website].


Help
----
We are interested in having feedback about how WMNut runs on other platforms
(BSD, Solaris, ...) and searching for packagers on those platforms.

If you have nice suggestions, ideas, whatever, that are not
on TODO list, feel free to post issues and pull requests at
https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut/releases

You can also try the NUT community support channels, as detailed at
https://networkupstools.org/support.html

FAQ
---

(How) Does WMNut support multiple UPS monitoring?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, WMNut can monitor up to 9 UPSs since release 0.1. Take a look at `HINTS`
file and manual page for more details about using this feature.

Can I set the initial size of WMNut?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, WMNut is limited to 64*64.

I'm not running WindowMaker nor AfterStep. How can I run WMNut in windowed mode (i.e. not having transparent background !)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try running `wmnut -w`. See below for a screenshot.

I can't compile WMNut ("undefined reference to `upslogx'", "upsfetch.h/o not found" or "upsclient.h/o not found") or WMNut doesn't work!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is always lots of improvements in both NUT and WMNut...

To solve your problem, you should upgrade to the most current release of NUT
and WMNut, and the problem should disappear -- it was solved in the past.
